# Framing

Acquisition and adaptation have both been viewed as distributional learning, and there are many similarities. But lots of apparent differences: acquisition is slow and hard, but adaptation is fast and relatively easy.  why?  there are at least two possible reasons: first, acquisition is unsupervised, adaptation is (often) supervised.  second: adult listeners have a lot of prior experience with different talkers to rely on during adaptation, while infants have prior experience only inasmuch as it's part of the genetic endowment which allows the acquisition of _any_ language.

# Other notes (RE CUNY abstract)

Big difference will be more thorough presentation of actual results.  Possibly including regression model?  Or not, it's not super informative.

Choice points will be 
* how to display the results: raw data, or predicted behavior from model?
* how to break up experiments?  (all shifts in one experiment, or 10, 20, 30 split up first time around?)

Figures:
* Paradigm (e.g. labeled and unlabeled trials)
* Stimulus distributions

# Splitting into two papers

Getting everything into a cog sci length paper is going to be tricky.  Florian suggests splitting into two papers: one focusing on the supervised/unsupervised conditions (only looking at 0ms and 10ms shifts) and the other focusing on the small vs. large shifts. The cog sci paper would definitely focus on the supervised bit, and the other paper could go either to cog sci or to CMCL.

## No effect of supervision

### Intro

Why?  Acquisition and adaptation both thought to be distributional learning.  But acquisition is slow and hard, while adaptation (appears) to be fast and (relatively) easy, or at least automatic/implicit.  Big difference is that adult listeners have a lot of information that allows them to guess the phonetic category of a sound, other than the acoustic cues themselves (visual cues, lexical context, etc.).  In acqusition, don't even know how _many_ categories there are.  That is, acquisition is basically unsupervised, while adaptation is often (partially) supervised.

### Results

Regression model: supervised vs. unsupervised, 0ms vs. 10ms shift.

Category boundaries (possibly over all trials...)

Labeled trials accuracy.

### Discussion

No effect of supervision! Why? Kind of label? Ceiling effect (but no effect in harder conditions either). Too fast?  Need different paradigm to evaluate adaptation after fewer exposures.

## Large shifts are only partially learned
